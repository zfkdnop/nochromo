# nochromo
Linux tweaks/optimizations for Chromebook installations

# Usage
Install your OS. Boot it. Download the repo and...

`sh ./nochromo-install.sh`

and then open ./nochromo-install.sh for viewing as there are 2 steps you need to manually take (because this file was originally just going to be an outline of what steps to take... after I finished implementing these changes on my installation I didnt want to take the time to brush up on bash scripting. Maybe I will in the future)
